# Practice

Using everything we've learned so far:

- Create two functions that are dependent on the other to output some data from a custom object

## Main function

- Create a new article element
- Populate with content from the object properties
- Return the new element

## Second Function

- Create a new figure element
- Populate with an image pointing to the image URL defined in the object
- Add <figcaption> with the image description
- Return the whole figure

## Continued Practice

- Use the querySelector and append method
- Pass the object to the main function
- Pass it to the figure function
- Return everything to the main function
